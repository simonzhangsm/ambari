{"name":"Artemis","tagline":"Interactive and Realtime Analytic Engine on Big Data","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Integrated Bundle for Interactive and Realtime Analytic Engine on Big Data\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to Artemis Pages\r\nThis is a developing mirror of apache ambari on Feb 1st 2014 by [simonzhangsm](https://github.com/simonzhangsm). This version will be released as artemis-1.6.0 against ambari-1.5.0. All involving features are included, such as ubuntu, python >= 3.0, ocean database and so on. \r\n\r\n#Artemis\r\n### A framework for provisioning, managing and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters.\r\n\r\nArtemis is a completely open operational framework for provisioning, managing and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters and all related bundles. Artemis includes an intuitive collection of operator tools and a set of APIs that hide the complexity of Hadoop, simplifying the operation of clusters. \r\n\r\nArtemis provides a simple way to try out a complete hadoop bundle of PostgreSQL and Hadoop. Our developer friendly bundle does not require you to be an Admin and it will not conflict with any software already installed on your system. Just unzip as a non-admin user and you are ready to rock.\r\n\r\n## What Artemis Does\r\n### Artemis enables system administrators to:\r\n\r\n* Provision a Hadoop Cluster\r\nNo matter the size of your Hadoop cluster, the deployment and maintenance of hosts is simplified using Artemis. Artemis includes an intuitive Web interface that allows you to easily provision, configure and test all the Hadoop services and core components.\r\nManage a Hadoop cluster\r\nArtemis provides tools to simplify cluster management. The Web interface allows you to start/stop/test Hadoop services, change configurations and manage ongoing growth of your cluster.\r\n\r\n* Monitor a Hadoop cluster\r\nGain instant insight into the health of your cluster. Artemis pre-configures alerts for watching Hadoop services and visualizes cluster operational data in a simple Web interface.\r\n\r\n* Artemis also includes job diagnostic tools to visualize job interdependencies and view task timelines as a way to troubleshoot historic job performance execution.\r\n\r\n* Integrate Hadoop with other applications\r\nArtemis provides a RESTful API that enables integration with existing tools, such as Microsoft System Center and Teradata Viewpoint. Artemis also leverages standard technologies and protocols with Nagios and Ganglia for deeper customization.\r\n\r\n* Interactive Query for Apache Hadoop:\r\n **Speed, Scale and SQL Compatibility with Apache Hive and PostgreSQL.** Artemis provides a leading massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL query engine that runs natively in Apache Hadoop, which combines modern, scalable parallel database technology with the power of Hadoop, enabling users to directly query data stored in HDFS and Apache HBase without requiring data movement or transformation. Artemis is designed from the ground up as part of the Hadoop ecosystem and shares the same flexible file and data formats, metadata, security and resource management frameworks used by MapReduce, Apache Hive, Apache Pig and other components of the Hadoop stack.\r\n\r\n## With artemis, you can:\r\n\r\n* Enable analysts and data scientists to directly interact with any data stored in Hadoop, using their existing business intelligence (BI) tools and skills through an industry-standard SQL interface.\r\n* Offload self-service business intelligence to Hadoop, relieving the burden on existing analytical databases and reducing your “BI backlog”.\r\n\r\n## Artemis delivers:\r\n* Performance equivalent to leading MPP databases, and 10-100x faster than Apache Hive/Stinger.\r\n* Faster time-to-insight than traditional databases by performing interactive analytics directly on data stored in Hadoop without data movement or predefined schemas.\r\n* Cost savings through reduced data movement, modeling, and storage.\r\n* More complete analysis of full raw and historical data, without information loss from aggregations or conforming to fixed schemas.\r\n* Familiarity of existing business intelligence tools and SQL skills to reduce barriers to adoption.\r\n* Security with Kerberos authentication, and role-based authorization through the Apache Sentry project.\r\n* Freedom from vendor lock-in through the open source Apache license.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n* Massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture for performance, with Hadoop scalability\r\n* Perform interactive analysis on any data stored in HDFS and HBase\r\n* Built with native Hadoop security: integrated with Kerberos for authentication and Apache Sentry for fine-grained, role-based authorization\r\n* ANSI-92 SQL support with user-defined functions (UDFs) Supports common Hadoop file formats: text, SequenceFiles, Avro, RCFile, LZO and Parquet\r\n* Shares workload management, metadata, ODBC driver, SQL syntax and user interface with Apache\r\n\r\n# How Artemis Works\r\nHadoop cluster provisioning and ongoing management can be a complicated task, especially when there are hundreds or thousands of hosts involved. Artemis provides a single control point for viewing, updating and managing Hadoop service life cycles, with these important features:\r\n\r\n* Wizard-driven installation of Hadoop services across any number of hosts\r\n* Granular configuration of Hadoop services and components\r\n* Ganglia for metrics collection and Nagios for system alerts\r\n* Advanced job diagnostic and troubleshooting tools\r\n* Robust RESTful APIs for customization and integration with enterprise systems\r\n* Cluster heatmaps","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
